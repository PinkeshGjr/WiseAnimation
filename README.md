# WiseAnimation Demo

A sophisticated SwiftUI iOS project demonstrating complex layout structures, fluid spatial animations, and robust architectural principles.

## Features
- **Custom Native Launch Screen**: Seamlessly blends a native UILaunchScreen directly into an identical SwiftUI animation sequence.
- **Advanced Core Animation**: Showcases complex 3D keyframe animations using custom shapes and rendering techniques.
- **MVVM Architecture**: A cleanly decoupled structure that separates presentation logic (Views) from routing and business logic (ViewModels).

## Requirements
- Xcode 18+
- iOS 18.0+
